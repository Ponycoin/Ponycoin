# Ponycoin `(PONY)`

Ever since the original Ponycoin (by a1batross) has been [discontinued](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=455133.0), we have been working on a revival of the coin, to live the original's legacy and a bit more.

### What is Ponycoin?

Ponycoin is a peer-to-peer digital Internet currency that enables instant payments to anyone around the world who is also using it.

It is based on the Bitcoin protocol, but differs from it in a way that it can efficiently be mined on fairly recent consumer-grade CPUs and GPUs.

That said, Ponycoin is created with a widescale community of [bronies](http://whatisabrony.com/) in mind. Feel free to use this coin, but make sure that you are okay with the fact that most of the coin's userbase will be fans of My Little Pony.

### Features:

- X11 Proof-of-work system: Mine fairly and efficiently across CPUs and GPUs, without the immediate worry of ASIC miners.
- 201,000,000 coins ready for you to mine.
- A new block is generated in ten seconds (flat).
- Initial Reward: 50 PONY, which will cut in half every 10,050,000 blocks.
- Wallet addresses always use `P` as a starting letter.
- No premining has been done, but the coin is well tested.

### Ponycoin Builds:

Current version: 0.8.6.3-g14426ce

- Windows (MinGW) (*Not quite built yet*)
